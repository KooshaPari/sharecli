## Measured coverage pin

| Field | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Source revision | `fa887e9d8c89dbc6764dad0d06082dcb139eeaad` (Wave17 T-810 lib pin — fast-forwarded over #771 + #773 + #774) |
| Scope | `--lib --all-features --locked --ignore-run-fail` (cargo llvm-cov 0.9.0; local run `local-lib-20260827` 2026-08-27) |
| Retained snapshot | `audit/coverage-snapshots/fa887e9.coverage-snapshot.json` |
| Measured line percentage | **77.34%** (27,947 lines; 21,615 covered) |
| Functions / regions | 79.79% functions (3,439 / 2,744); 80.14% regions (49,622 / 39,765) |
| Meets 85% unit gate? | **No** (`meets_lines_target: false`); PR hard gate uses `--lib` scope per `quality-gate.yml` |
| Scope note | `--workspace --all-features broad` measurement blocked on Windows for this pin cycle by integration-test compatibility regressions in `tests/fr008_coalesce_mesh` (operator-env critical-timeout hang) and `tests/fr009_fuse_*` (FUSE-specific Linux/macOS code paths). The `--lib` scope is what `quality-gate.yml` hard-gates; the `--workspace` measurement is supplementary. The prior workspace pin at `5d8dc08` / **80.51%** remains the most recent broad measurement and is retained as historical evidence. |

### Wave18 workspace-broad pin (T-910 — current broad measurement)

| Field | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Source revision | `d152eda` (Wave18 T-910 workspace-broad remeasure; main at measurement time) |
| Scope | `--workspace --all-features --locked --ignore-run-fail --summary-only` (cargo llvm-cov 0.9.0; local WSL Linux run 2026-09-03) |
| Retained snapshot | `audit/coverage-snapshots/d152eda.coverage-snapshot.json` |
| Measured line percentage | **82.38%** (36,519 lines; 44,330 total) |
| Functions / regions | 84.34% functions (4,681 / 5,550); 83.39% regions (65,219 / 78,208) |
| Meets 85% unit gate? | **No** (workspace-broad is supplementary; `--lib` is the hard-gate scope) |
| Scope note | This is the first successful `--workspace --all-features broad` measurement since the pre-T-810 lifts. It supersedes the prior broad pin **80.51%** @ `5d8dc08` and closes the Phase-1 `T-910` recovery-plan task ("unblock workspace measurement"). The `--lib` pin **77.34%** @ `fa887e9` remains the value hard-gated by `quality-gate.yml`. Measured on WSL (Linux) after resolving the Zig 0.14.x toolchain requirement for `spawn-core` and relocating `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` off the tmpfs. |

### Prior pin (superseded for current cycle)

| Field | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Prior revision | `5d8dc08928c7258110f8a20c7e0fafd9f474f22e` (Wave16 T-730 pin refresh) |
| Prior scope | `--workspace --all-features --locked --ignore-run-fail` (broad workspace) |
| Prior snapshot | `audit/coverage-snapshots/5d8dc08.coverage-snapshot.json` (retained; **80.51%** lines @ `5d8dc08`) |
| Prior line percentage | **80.51%** (40,077 lines; 32,266 covered) |
| Functions / regions | 83.23% functions; 82.21% regions (same `5d8dc08` snapshot) |
| Note | Superseded for the Wave17 T-810 lib pin **77.34%** @ `fa887e9`; **80.51%** snapshot retained as historical evidence. Wave17 T-810 #771 added 6 tests for session + coordination coverage but the broad-workspace remeasure was blocked on Windows. |

### Wave15 / #399 → remeasure → #583 climb (2026-07-22..23)

| Field | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Coverage-lift merge | `922b4ae` — [#399](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/pull/399) |
| Empty-suite stall | Runs [29872308604](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/actions/runs/29872308604) / [29967745465](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/actions/runs/29967745465) failed guard before llvm-cov |
| Remeasure | [#580](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/pull/580) fixed `CARGO_TERM_COLOR=never` / empty-suite false positive; run [29985746034](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/actions/runs/29985746034) produced **80.51%** @ `5d8dc08` |
| Coverage climb | [#583](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/pull/583) @ `8c68bb5`; run [30005505196](https://github.com/KooshaPari/sharecli/actions/runs/30005505196) measured **81.17%** lines |
| Honest action | Pin **81.22%** at `28bfb10` from CI artifact — do **not** invent a higher percentage |

The compact snapshot records covered/count/percentage totals for lines, functions,
regions, and branches, plus the source SHA, Actions run ID, 85% target, and whether
the measured line percentage meets that target. Numeric percentages are pinned only
from retained llvm-cov snapshots.

### 85% enforcement

The 85% line target is a hard PR gate in
`.github/workflows/quality-gate.yml`: `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=85` is passed to
`cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines` for the documented unit-test scope. A result
below 85% makes the `unit-tests` job fail. The lib pin (`fa887e9` 77.34%) and the
retained workspace pin (`5d8dc08` 80.51%) are both below 85%; the
`meets_lines_target: false` flag in each snapshot makes target drift machine-readable.

### Codecov supplementary policy

`codecov.yml` remains **supplementary** to the hard gates:

| Layer | Target | Scope |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `quality-gate.yml` | **85% lines** (hard) | `--lib` unit scope with documented filename ignores |
| `coverage.yml` snapshot (current) | **77.34% lines** @ `fa887e9` (lib pin) | `--lib --all-features --locked --ignore-run-fail` |
| `coverage.yml` snapshot (retained) | **80.51% lines** @ `5d8dc08` | `--workspace --all-features` broad measurement (historical) |
| Codecov `project` | 70% + 1% threshold | `src/**/*.rs` upload from quality-gate LCOV |
| Codecov `patch` | 80% + 1% threshold | PR diff only |

The pinned lib percentage does not lower the 85% unit gate; it documents the
current state of `--lib` measurement for prioritization. The retained 80.51%
workspace pin documents the most recent broad measurement pre-T-810 lifts.

## Coverage Gaps

### Critical Gaps
1. Homebrew bottle sha still PLACEHOLDER (`WORK_DAG` Wave4 / C11).
2. `--lib` line coverage **77.34%** is below the 85% unit gate target (gap for prioritization; unit gate unchanged).
3. `--workspace --all-features broad` measurement now unblocked on WSL/Linux (Wave18 T-910) — **82.38%** @ `d152eda`; still below the 85% unit gate, but workspace-broad is a supplementary scope (the `--lib` scope is what `quality-gate.yml` hard-gates).

## Wave18 Coverage Recovery Plan (ADR-007)

| Phase | Target | Scope | Effort | Tasks | Timeline |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Unblock workspace measurement | `--workspace` >=80% | M | T-910 | Week 1 |
| Phase 2 | Lift --lib to 80% | `--lib` >=80% | L | T-920 | Week 2-3 |
| Phase 3 | Lift to 85%+ | `--lib` >=85% | L | T-930 | Week 4 |

### Phase 1: Unblock workspace measurement (T-910)

1. Add `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` / `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` gate to FUSE-specific test paths in `tests/fr009_*`
2. Fix `tests/fr008_coalesce_mesh` timeout by wrapping in `tokio::time::timeout`
3. Add `--workspace` measurement to CI as supplementary (not blocking)

### Phase 2: Lift --lib to 80% (T-920)

| Module | Lines to cover | Test approach |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| `serve_rate_limit.rs` | ~40 | Unit tests for rate limit exhaustion, token bucket refill |
| `serve_auth.rs` | ~30 | JWT validation edge cases, expired token, malformed header |
| `config_watcher.rs` | ~50 | Mock filesystem events, debounce timer test |
| `thermal.rs` | ~25 | Platform-conditional mock thermal readings |
| `dashboard_assets.rs` | ~20 | Asset MIME type mapping tests |
| `alloc.rs` | ~15 | jemalloc/dhat feature gate compilation tests |
| **Total** | **~180 lines** | |

### Phase 3: Lift to 85%+ (T-930)

1. Add integration tests for `serve` endpoints with mock state
2. Add `fr012_serve_jwt_auth` edge case tests (token rotation, audience mismatch)
3. Add `fr011_thermal_gate` platform mock tests
4. Add `fr008_coalesce_mesh` mesh convergence tests with mocked network
5. Pin final 85%+ snapshot with `meets_lines_target: true`

### Ratchet Mechanism

Once 85% is achieved, the ratchet locks:
- `quality-gate.yml` `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 85` is never decreased
- Each coverage-lift PR includes `audit/coverage-snapshots/<sha>.coverage-snapshot.json`
- `COVERAGE_RATCHET: true` prevents lowering the threshold

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Restore `--workspace --all-features broad` remeasurement on Linux/WSL runner (operator-env critical-timeout fix in `tests/fr008_coalesce_mesh` + FUSE cfg gate consistency in `tests/fr009_*`).
2. Keep FR annotations (`//! FR: FR-NNN`) on every new acceptance test.
3. Sync status tokens in `docs/ops/governance/GAP-QA-MATRIX.md` + `WBS-PHASED.md`.

### Short-term Actions
1. Claim Wave4 packaging (brew sha after `v*` attach) or residual C10 hex drift (T-692).

### Wave18 Actions (NEW)
1. Claim T-910 to unblock workspace measurement (ADR-007 Phase 1).
2. Claim T-920 to lift --lib to 80% (ADR-007 Phase 2).
3. Claim T-930 to reach 85% gate (ADR-007 Phase 3).
