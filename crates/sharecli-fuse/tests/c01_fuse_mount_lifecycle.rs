//! FR: FR-009
//!
//! C01 — live FUSE mount lifecycle depth tests.
//!
//! Exercises:
//!   1. Two `MountSession` instances running concurrently over disjoint
//!      backing roots (multi-mount scenario).
//!   2. Multiple reader threads accessing the same FUSE mountpoint at the
//!      same time (concurrent-read scenario).
//!   3. Mounting onto a non-empty mountpoint directory preserves the
//!      existing user files (empty-mountpoint recycling policy in
//!      `lib.rs` around line 990).
//!
//! Each test isolates state with its own `tempfile::TempDir` (backing,
//! mountpoint, and seed file are all local to the test). Live mounts are
//! gated behind `SHARECLI_FUSE_MOUNT_SMOKE=1` so default `cargo test`
//! remains offline (mirrors the pattern in `tests/fr009_fuse_intercept.rs`).
//! When the env var is unset, each test reports `skipped` and exits
//! cleanly; the integration suite stays green without macFUSE / libfuse
//! privileges.
